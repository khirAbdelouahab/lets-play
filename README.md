# Secure Product Management System: A Spring Boot & MongoDB Implementation

Let's Play is a production-ready RESTful API developed using Spring Boot and MongoDB, designed to manage users and products in a secure, scalable environment. The system implements token-based authentication (JWT) and role-based authorization to ensure that only authorized users can perform restricted operations.

## Key features include:

- Complete CRUD operations for users and products
- JWT authentication with secure token generation and validation
- Role-based access control (ADMIN and USER roles)
- Owner-based authorization for resource management
- Comprehensive global exception handling
- RESTful API design following industry best practices
- Stateless session management for scalability
